# Day 3 – Create a Subnet in AWS

## Objective
Create a subnet in AWS to segment a VPC into smaller, manageable networks for better organization and security.

## Services Used
- Amazon VPC

## Steps Performed
- Logged in to the AWS Management Console via lab credentials
- Navigated to **VPC Dashboard**
- Clicked on **Subnets** in the left-hand menu
- Clicked **Create subnet**
- Selected:
   - VPC: **Choose your existing VPC**
   - Subnet name: **Enter a descriptive name**
   - Availability Zone: **Select desired AZ**
   - IPv4 CIDR block: **Enter subnet CIDR (e.g., 10.0.1.0/24)**
- Clicked **Create subnet**

## Outcome
- Successfully created a subnet within the selected VPC
- Subnet is ready for launching EC2 instances or other AWS resources

## Notes
- Subnets divide a VPC’s IP range into smaller sections for organized resource allocation
- Public subnets can be configured with a route to an Internet Gateway
- Private subnets can be kept isolated for internal resources
